# Blabber
You know that "friend" that just won't stop talking!? That's true for a lot of our devices as well. This repo provides a suite of tools that sniff, impersonate, and track devices via Bluetooth, WiFi, and other protocols. 

# Motivation
@ DEFCON 2023, event goers were intrigued by the constant request being broadcasted to setup a nearby AppleTV. We were no exception to this and knew we had to figure out how it was being accmplished ASAP. After much research, we found a few PoCs that were similar in nature, but none actually displayed the AppleTV setup functionality displayed at DEFCON. We wanted to fix that and we did! We plan to create other tools surrounding wireless sniffing, impersonation, and tracking.

# Impersonate

Here for the AppleTV Setup PoC? Head over to the "impersonate" folder to get started!
